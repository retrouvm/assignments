Which 2 versions are unsafe when multi-threaded?
sum2.c: The sum2 function uses a static variable sumsq. In a multi-threaded environment, if multiple threads call this function simultaneously, they could interfere with each other since they would be sharing the same sumsq variable. This could result in incorrect answers.
sum5.c: The sum5 function allocates memory for a sum struct using malloc. If multiple threads call this function simultaneously, they might allocate and modify the same memory, leading to data corruption or incorrect results.

Which version is closest to call-by-name?
The version closest to call-by-name is sum3.c. In this version, the sum3 function returns a pointer to a sum_t struct, allowing the caller to directly access the results. This is similar to call-by-name semantics where you can access the results by name (e.g., m->x, m->y, m->z) without explicitly passing variables as arguments to the function.
